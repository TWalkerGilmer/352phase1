testcase_main(): started
QUICK SUMMARY: Same as test27, except with different priorities - which means that pid3 is not set by the time that XXp2() attempts to use it.
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = `XXp1'
testcase_main(): after fork of child 4
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): arg = `XXp2'
XXp2(): calling zap(0)
XXp2(): return value of zap(0) is -3
testcase_main(): after fork of child 5
XXp3(): started
XXp3(): arg = `XXp3'
XXp3(): after fork of child 7
XXp3(): performing first join
testcase_main(): after fork of child 6
testcase_main(): performing first join
testcase_main(): exit status for child 5 is 2
testcase_main(): performing second join
testcase_main(): exit status for child 4 is 1
testcase_main(): performing third join
XXp4(): started
XXp4(): arg = `XXp4FromXXp3a'
XXp3(): exit status for child 7 is 4
testcase_main(): exit status for child 6 is 3
